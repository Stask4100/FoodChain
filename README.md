# FoodChain

**FoodChain** is a Spring Boot project that simulates a **food chain**.  
You can create animals (lions, goats, cows) and grass, as well as perform actions:
- feed animals
- view all created animals
- find animals by name
- handle errors (e.g., dead animals cannot be fed, grass cannot be eaten twice).

##  Technologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot** (Web, Data JPA)
- **Hibernate**
- **H2 Database** (in-memory, for testing)
- **MySQL** (main database)
- **JUnit 5 + Mockito** (testing)

---

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stask4100/foodchain.git
   ```

2. Configure `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/foodchain?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=password
   ```

   > Replace **foodchain**, **username**, and **password** with your own database configuration.

3. Start the application:
   - Run `FoodChainApplication`
   - Ensure MySQL is running and properly connected
   - Open **Postman** (or similar tool)
   - Test endpoints, e.g.:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/lions
     ```
